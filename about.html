                  <p>
                    I am an intuitive, hard-working person. A fast visual learner who critiques my work. As a preference I like working on my own, but I have absolutely no problem working with a group. I am not much of a social person, but I do interact when I am comfortable.

                  <h3>Where did your passion for coding start:</h3>
                  <p>Growing up I was always fascinated by computers, so as soon as an opportunity to work with computers presented itself, I grabbed it with both hands. I started working with code in 2017 when I was introduced to a one-year coding course and was fascinated by the course. </p>
